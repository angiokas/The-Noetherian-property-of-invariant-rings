# The-Noetherian-property-of-invariant-rings

Let $G$ be a finite group and let $R$ be a Noetherian ring containing $\mathbb{Q}$. Then if $G$ acts on $R$, the invariant ring $R^G$ is also Noetherian. 
Note that this works in characteristic 0 rings that contain $\mathbb{Q}$ because of the use of the Reynolds operator.

- Does this work in positive characteristic $p$?
  Not in general, however there is no general statement showing that. In general, char $p$ counter argument does not exist so far, however there is a known counterexample in characteristic 2. 
- Are there ways to weaken the statement so that it does work for all of some specific rings of positive characteristic? Yes.
